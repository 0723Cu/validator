# # [02:06] <Philip`> "Fatal Error: Last error required non-streamable recovery." doesn't sound like a very user-friendly message - I think it'd make more sense if it said something like "Fatal Error: Cannot recover after last error - any further errors will be ignored"


# # [01:55] <zcorpan> hsivonen: also for imageshack: "Error: First occurrence of id mist." (message #6) -- shouldn't that be Info instead of Error?

# # [01:44] <zcorpan> hsivonen: your html5 schema doesn't seem to allow noscript in head

case fold in HTML 4 mode

< zcorpan> hsivonen: feature request: it would be useful to be able to 
                 group errors by message (perhaps so by default even), because 
                 often there are lots of errors of the same type and you 
                 usually fix them with a search-and-replace

< hendry> be good if you could link into CSS validators and things like 
                jslint.com too

< hendry> hsivonen: i think it is useful to know how big your Web page 
                is. And to ensure that something sensible like gzip compression 
                on the server is being utilised

< hendry> hsivonen: could you use the WHATWG favicon on validator? I have 
                so many tabs open nowadays. If things don't have a favicon I'm 
                lost :)

23:31 < zcorpan_lap> hsivonen: it would be useful to be able to suggest and/or 
                     override encoding
23:32 < hsivonen> zcorpan_lap: on file upload?
23:32 < hsivonen> zcorpan_lap: or in general_
23:32 < hsivonen> ?
23:32 < zcorpan_lap> at least file upload

23:35  * zcorpan_lap tried to enter http://validator.nu/?showsource=yes in 
          opera:config but it didn't have the desired effect :(

14:39 < Philip> hsivonen: Why does 
http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fphilip.html5.org%2F404&schema=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.web3d.org%2Fspecifications%2Fx3d-3.1.xsd&parser=xml&laxtype=yes&showsource=yes say an HTML page validates according to the XML schema?
